This repository contains the following files:

- pedcyc_collision_06-21.geojson : the geojson file containing all pedestrian collisions in Toronto from 2006 to 2021
- index.html : the HTML file to render map and elements
- script.js : javascript file for rendering interactivity and using data from the geojson file
- style.css : the CSS file for map styling and positioning

ChatGPT was used to generate the expression representing the colours in the hexgrid visualization. The specific lines that used ChatGPT has been noted in a comment in the index.html file.

The interactive buttons in this map shows the boundary of all collisions, with the area divided into hexagons and a range of collisions shown in the legend.
